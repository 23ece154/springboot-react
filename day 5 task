.build():

-> User.builder() starts building a user object step by step.
-> You add details like:
    * .username("admin")
    * .password(...)
    * .roles("ADMIN")
->These are just settings – the user object isn't created yet.
->.build() is used to create the final user object from all the settings you gave.
->Without .build(), you won’t get a usable UserDetails object.


CSRF:

  WHAT?
->CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.
->It’s an attack where a hacker tricks you into doing something on a site where you are already logged in.
->Example: You’re logged into your bank. A fake site tricks your browser into sending a money transfer request.
->It works because your browser automatically sends login cookies.
  
  HOW TO SOLVE THEM?
->Websites use a CSRF token (a secret value) with forms to make sure the request is real.
->If the token is missing or wrong, the site blocks the request.
->Spring Security protects against CSRF by default.
->If you are building a REST API, you can disable CSRF:
          http.csrf().disable();
->Disable it only if you are not using cookies.
